This is repackaging of the simple python module for manipulating semantic version numbers. Refer to the
[github repo](https://github.com/rbarrois/python-semanticversion) for more information.

The only difference between this catkin package and the original module is in the package name - here
use rocon_semantic_version.xxx instead of semantic_version.xxx. This is only to avoid a possible conflict
with this catkin installed package vs a pip installed package.
